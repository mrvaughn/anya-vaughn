      <p>As the only person in a family of five who chose not to go into the field of classical music, Anya Vaughn has
        always
        been the odd one out.
        Music played a big part in her childhood, and she took lessons in violin, piano, and trombone, but ultimately
        decided
        against pursuing it as a career.
        However, her musical background does inform her passion for animation, as she has been immersed in the concepts
        of
        timing, rhythm, and movement since she
        was a kid. She often incorporates her musical inspirations into her work.
        Her thesis project, for example, is being made in collaboration with a composer and childhood friend,
        <a href="https://www.mattridgemusic.com/">Matt Ridge</a>.
        They are both utilizing
        experimentation for this project, with digitally distorted audio and surreal visuals rendered in scratchboard.

      <p>Anya's interest in music has developed her ability to think creatively beyond graphic elements. As an
        undergraduate
        major in animation at
        <a href="https://www.mica.edu">MICA</a>, she has been awarded several scholarships and prizes, including:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The Bill Woody and Tom Miller Scholarship</li>
        <li>The Academic Excellence Scholarship</li>

        <li>The MICA NAHS Scholarship</li>
        <li>The MICA Creative Vision Award.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Anya was also awarded an Honorable Mention from NASAâ€™s Conceptual Image Lab Award for her paint-on-glass
        animation,
        <em>You are the Sky</em>, which
        was a collaboration with poetry reading and dance. Her work has been featured in:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><em>Opening Doors: Scholarship Donor Student Exhibition</em></li>
        <li><em>Jump the Turnstile</em> shows sponsored by Arts by the People</li>
